- name: Blood Pressure monitoring rate
  explanation: >
    A commonly-used assessment used to identify patients with hypertension or to ensure optimal treatment for those with known hypertension.
    This helps ensure appropriate treatment, with the aim of reducing long term risks of complications from hypertension such as stroke,
    myocardial infarction and kidney disease.
  caveats: >
    We use codes which represent results reported to GPs so tests requested but not yet reported are not included.
    Only test results returned to GPs are included,
    which will usually exclude tests requested while a person is in hospital and other settings like a private clinic.

- name: Cholesterol testing rate
  explanation: >
    A commonly-used blood test used as part of a routine cardiovascular disease 10 year risk assessment
    and also to identify patients with lipid disorders (e.g. familial hypercholesterolaemia).
    This helps ensure appropriate treatment,
    with the aim of reducing long term risks of complications such as stroke or myocardial infarction.

- name: Liver Function Testing - Alanine Transferaminase (ALT)
  explanation: >
    An ALT blood test is one of a group of liver function tests (LFTs) which are used to detect problems with the function of the liver.
    It is often used to monitor patients on medications which may affect the liver or which rely on the liver to break them down within the body.
    They are also tested for patients with known or suspected liver dysfunction.
  caveats: >
    **In a small number of places, an ALT test may NOT be included within a liver function test.**
    We use codes which represent results reported to GPs so tests requested but not yet reported are not included.
    Only tests results returned to GPs are included,
    which will usually exclude tests requested while a person is in hospital and other settings like a private clinic.
