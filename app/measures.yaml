- name: "Methotrexate: LFT safety monitoring completion rate"
  explanation: >
    An ALT blood test is one of a group of liver function tests (LFTs) which are used to detect problems with the function of the liver.
    Patients taking methotrexate are recommended to have their LFTs checked at least every 3 months.
    Following these recommendations helps identify any signs of liver toxicity in these patients, which reduces the risk of adverse drug events.
  caveats: >
    In a small number of places, an ALT test may NOT be included within a liver function test.
    We use codes which represent results reported to GPs so tests requested but not yet reported are not included.
    Only tests results returned to GPs are included, which will usually exclude tests requested while a person is in hospital and other settings like a private clinic.
