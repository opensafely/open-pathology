# Dashboards

We will develop dashboards with [Streamlit][]
and deploy dashboards to the Streamlit [Community Cloud][].

In Community Cloud, a dashboard is known as an *app*
and an app corresponds to a Python file in a GitHub repository.

We will create apps in our individual accounts,
which are known as *source control accounts*.
An alternative approach would be to create apps in a shared account,
which is known as a *linked account*,
and to link the shared account to our individual accounts.
However, this approach is not well supported by Community Cloud.

A Google group and a [Bitwarden][] item,
both called "Streamlit Community Cloud",
were created for the shared account.
They have been retained, should they be needed in the future.
